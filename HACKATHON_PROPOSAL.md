# CivicGrievance Platform - Hackathon Proposal

## 🎯 Project Overview

**CivicGrievance** is a public, data-driven grievance and accountability platform that transforms citizen complaints into transparent, accountable action and policy intelligence.

**Tagline**: *Twitter + Google Maps + RTI-style accountability + AI reporting*

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **For Citizens**:
   - Issues scattered across WhatsApp, Twitter, verbal complaints
   - No accountability or proof of resolution
   - Lack of transparency in government responses
   - No way to prioritize critical issues

2. **For Municipalities**:
   - Unstructured complaint management
   - No historical insight into recurring problems
   - Poor documentation of responses
   - Difficult resource allocation

3. **For Policy Makers**:
   - No reliable ground-level datasets
   - Limited trend analysis capabilities
   - Policy decisions lack data-driven insights
   - No accountability metrics

# Problem Statement

## The Challenge

Civic issues in our communities are scattered, poorly documented, and rarely resolved with accountability. Citizens face multiple barriers when trying to report infrastructure problems, and governments lack structured data to make informed policy decisions.

## Current State Problems

### For Citizens
1. **Scattered Reporting**: Issues are reported across WhatsApp groups, Twitter, verbal complaints, and various platforms with no central tracking
2. **No Accountability**: Complaints disappear into bureaucratic voids with no proof of resolution
3. **Lack of Transparency**: No visibility into what issues are being addressed and by whom
4. **No Prioritization**: Important issues get lost among noise

### For Municipal Authorities
1. **Unstructured Data**: No centralized system to receive and track citizen complaints
2. **No Historical Insight**: Cannot identify recurring problems or patterns
3. **Poor Documentation**: Responses are not systematically recorded with proof
4. **Resource Allocation**: Difficult to prioritize based on citizen needs

### For Policy Makers
1. **No Ground Data**: Lack reliable, bottom-up datasets tied to real responses
2. **No Trend Analysis**: Cannot identify systemic issues or measure effectiveness
3. **Limited Evidence**: Policy decisions lack data-driven insights
4. **No Accountability Metrics**: Cannot track government performance on civic issues
